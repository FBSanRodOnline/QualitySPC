## ✨ Key Features

### 📈 X-Bar & R Charts
* **Automated Analysis:** Instantly calculates Control Limits (UCL/LCL) using standard ASTM constants ($A_2, D_3, D_4$).
* **Flexible Input:** Supports single-column data (with auto-subgrouping) or pre-grouped row data.
* **Visuals:** Clear, interactive charts for Process Mean and Variation.

### 🔔 Process Capability Analysis ($C_{pk}$ / $P_{pk}$)
* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates full "Six Pack" style reports including Histograms with Normal Curves.
* **Advanced Metrics:** Calculates $C_p, C_{pk}, P_p, P_{pk}, C_{pm}$, and Sigma Level.
* **Performance Data:** Includes detailed PPM (Parts Per Million) analysis for Observed vs. Expected performance.
* **Correct Mathematics:** Distinguishes between *Within* variation (using $\bar{R}/d_2$) and *Overall* variation (standard deviation) for accurate short-term vs. long-term analysis.

### 📏 Gage R&R Study (Crossed)
* **AIAG Standard:** Uses the industry-standard "Average and Range" method.
* **Diagnostic Charts:** Generates a full grid of 6 diagnostic charts (Components of Variation, Interaction, By Operator, By Part, etc.) to identify root causes of measurement error.
* **Key Metrics:** Calculates % Study Variation, % Tolerance, and Number of Distinct Categories (NDC).

### 📝 Professional Reporting
* **PDF Export:** One-click generation of professional PDF reports for all analysis tools.
* **Customizable Headers:** Add your Company Name, Representative Name, and Logo to reports for official documentation.
